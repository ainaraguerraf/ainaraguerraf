### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ainara

I am a creative and innovative data analyst with over four years of experience in digital marketing and communications. With a background in design and technology-focused companies, I have developed a unique approach to problem solving and continuous improvement in my work. 

My experience includes a wide range of data analytics, business intelligence and data science tools. I am now focused on moving towards data science and advanced data visualization training. 

If you want to meet me, in my free time I will probably be in some museum or art gallery near Madrid drawing and enjoying art.
